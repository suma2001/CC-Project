## Overview
Our objective for this project is to build a simple web interface that allows users to both upload and query their images. This was primarily done using Rekognition (which is triggered on uploading an image to S3). It takes the image from S3 and then returns the response to DynamoDB. It also supports multiple users, with the help of Cognito.
